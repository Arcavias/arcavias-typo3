What does it do?
----------------

The Arcavias TYPO3 extension is a high performance web shop based on the Arcavias e-commerce
framework. It integrates natively into TYPO3, uses the TYPO3 infrastructure and is fully
configurable via TypoScript.

Arcavias can efficiently handle 100 000+ products in a standard MySQL database with response
times around one second using the TYPO3 infrastructure including RealURL. For optimal
performance you need to install APC, the PHP byte code cache.
